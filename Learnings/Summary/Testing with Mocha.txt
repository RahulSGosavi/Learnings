Testing with Mocha

What is Mocha?
Mocha is a popular JavaScript testing framework.
It helps you automatically test your code to check if everything works as expected.

1. Why Test?
Manual testing is slow and error-prone.
Mocha helps you write automated tests that run every time you change the code.

2. Setting Up Mocha
1. Install Node.js
2. Run in terminal:
npm install mocha -g
3. Create an HTML file and include:
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mocha/mocha.js"></script>
<link href="https://unpkg.com/mocha/mocha.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="https://unpkg.com/chai/chai.js"></script>
4. Add this to start Mocha:
<div id="mocha"></div>
<script>mocha.setup('bdd')</script>
5. Finally:
mocha.run();

 3. Writing a Test
Basic structure:
describe("sum function", function() {
  it("adds 1 + 2 = 3", function() {
    assert.equal(sum(1, 2), 3);
  });
});
 Breakdown:
* describe() – groups tests
* it() – describes a single test case
* assert.equal() – checks if the result matches expectation

 4. Using Chai for Assertions
Chai is used to write readable test expectations.

assert.equal(actual, expected);

5. Running Tests in Browser
Open the HTML file with test code.
You’ll see the Mocha UI in the browser showing pass/fail status for each test.

Key Takeaways
* Mocha helps you automate testing in JavaScript
* Tests are grouped with describe() and run with it()
* Use assert to compare actual results with expected ones
* You can run tests easily in the browser or with Node.js

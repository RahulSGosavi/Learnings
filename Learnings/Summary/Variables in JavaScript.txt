Variables in JavaScript
1. What is a Variable?
A variable is a container for storing data. In JavaScript, we use let, const, or var to declare variables.
For Example:
let name = "Rahul";  
console.log(name); // Output: Rahul

2. Declaring Variables
let:
Preferred for most cases (allows changing values)
const:
For values that should not change


var:
Old way (avoid using it)
Example:
let age = 25;  // Can be changed later
const birthYear = 1999;  // Cannot be changed
var city = "Delhi";  // Avoid using `var`

3. Changing Variable Values
let mood = "happy";
mood = "excited";  
console.log(mood); // Output: excited
const variables cannot be changed:
const pi = 3.14;
pi = 3.14159; // Error: Cannot reassign a constant variable

4. Variable Naming Rules
Allowed:
* Letters (name)
* Digits (name1)
* $ and _ ($price, _value)
Not Allowed:
* Spaces (user name)
* Special characters (#user, @age)
* Starting with a number (1variable)
 Example of valid names:
let userName = "Rahul";  
let _score = 100;  
let $amount = 50;

Key Insights:
Use let for variables that change.
Use const for values that should stay the same.
Avoid var because it has unexpected behavior.
Follow proper naming rules for better readability.

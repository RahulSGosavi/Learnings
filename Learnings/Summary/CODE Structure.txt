CODE Structure
In this page I understand the basic structure of a JavaScript program and best practices for writing clean, readable code.
1. Writing JavaScript Code
* JavaScript is written as a series of statements.
* Each statement ends with a semicolon ( ; ), but itâ€™s optional in most cases.


2. Code Blocks
* A block is a group of statements inside curly braces {}.
* Example:
javascript
CopyEdit
{
  let a = 10;
  console.log(a); 
}
* Blocks are used in functions, loops, and conditional statements.


3. Indentation and Readability
* Proper indentation and spacing make code easier to read.
* Example of well-structured code:
javascript
CopyEdit
if (true) {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}
* Using new lines and spaces improves readability.


4. Comments in JavaScript
* Single-line comment: // This is a comment
* Multi-line comment:
javascript
CopyEdit
/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  It helps explain complex code.
*/
* Comments help describe the purpose of the code but should not be overused.


Key Insights
JavaScript code is made up of statements, organized using blocks {}, and should be properly formatted with comments for clarity.

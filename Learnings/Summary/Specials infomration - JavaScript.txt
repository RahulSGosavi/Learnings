"Specials" – Key Things to Know
This article gives a quick overview of important core concepts in JavaScript that beginners often find confusing or forget.

1. Case-sensitive Language
JavaScript is case-sensitive:
myVar, MyVar, and MYVAR are different variables.

 2. Statements and Semicolons
* Each instruction is called a statement.
* JavaScript auto-adds semicolons, but it's safer to write them yourself.
let a = 5;
let b = 10;

3. Comments
* Single-line: //
* Multi-line: /* ... */
// This is a comment
/* This is 
a multi-line comment */

 4. Use Strict Mode
Helps catch errors and bad practices.

CopyEdit
"use strict";
Use at the top of your code or function.

5. Variables: let, const, var
* let block-scoped, can be reassigned
* const block-scoped, cannot be reassigned
* var function-scoped (old way)
 Prefer let and const over var

 6. Data Types
JavaScript has 8 basic types:
TypeExampleNumber123, 3.14String"hello"Booleantrue, falseNullnullUndefinedundefinedObject{ name: "Rahul" }SymbolSymbol("id")BigInt12345678901234567890n
 7. Type Conversions
JavaScript automatically converts types in some situations.
Example:
alert("5" - 1); // 4
 "5" becomes number because - expects numbers.

8. Operators
Common ones:
* +, -, *, /, % (modulo)
* == (loose equality)
* === (strict equality)
* !, &&, ||

 9. Control Structures
* if, else, switch
* while, for
* break, continue
Example:

if (age > 18) {
  alert("Adult");
}

 10. Functions
Basic function:
function greet(name) {
  alert("Hello, " + name);
}
Can also be stored in variables (function expressions).

 Quick Takeaway
JavaScript has some unique behaviors and it's good to understand the "special" things like:
* Auto type conversion
* Strict mode
* Case-sensitivity
* Differences between let, var, const

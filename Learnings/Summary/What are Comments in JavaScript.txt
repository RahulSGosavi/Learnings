What are Comments in JavaScript?
Comments are parts of the code that are ignored by JavaScript.
They help you or others understand the code later.
 1. Single-line Comment
Use // for single-line notes.
// This is a single-line comment
let age = 25; // age of the user

 2. Multi-line Comment
Use /* ... */ for comments that span multiple lines.
/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  You can write as much as you want here.
*/
let name = "Rahul";

 3. Using Comments to Disable Code
You can comment out code to temporarily disable it without deleting:
// alert("This won't run");
alert("This will run");

 When to Use Comments?
* To explain what the code does
* To make the code easier to read
* To remind yourself or others why something was done
* To turn off lines for testing/debugging

 Avoid Obvious Comments:
Don’t write comments that just repeat the code.
// Set age to 25   unnecessary
let age = 25;

 Good Comment Example:
// Check if the user is old enough to see the content
if (age >= 18) {
  showContent();
}

Loops: while And For

In This page I understand loops in JavaScript, which allow repeating actions multiple times.

1. The while Loop
Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.
javascript
CopyEdit
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {  
  console.log(i);  
  i++;  // Increase i to avoid infinite loop
}
Use while when the number of iterations is unknown in advance.

2. The do...while Loop
Runs at least once, then continues if the condition is true.
javascript
CopyEdit
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
 Use do...while when you need to execute the block at least once.

3. The for Loop
A compact loop with an initialization, condition, and update in one line.
javascript
CopyEdit
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
 Use for when you know how many times the loop should run.

4. Breaking a Loop (break)
Stops a loop immediately when a condition is met.
javascript
CopyEdit
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) break;  // Stop when i is 5
  console.log(i);
}

5. Skipping Iterations (continue)
Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
javascript
CopyEdit
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 2) continue; // Skip 2
  console.log(i);
}

6. Infinite Loops (Avoid These!)
A loop without an exit condition will run forever and crash the program.
javascript
CopyEdit
while (true) {
  console.log("This will never stop!"); // Avoid infinite loops
}

Key Insights
* Use while when the number of iterations is unknown.
* Use for when the loop count is predefined.
* Use break to stop a loop early.
* Use continue to skip certain iterations.
* Be careful of infinite loops, as they can freeze your program.
